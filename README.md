# Pinterest Image Scraper
Download all relevant images under a pin.

## Why This Script?
This modification is to update the script as it's quite outdated, and to batch-download multiple links at once.

It will also create downloaded.txt in the download directory to prevent the script from downloading the same image twice.

## How to Run:
1. Please follow the instructions to install the scraper from [here](https://github.com/xjdeng/pinterest-image-scraper)
1. Edit `config_sample.py` with your information, then rename it to `config.py`
1. Run the script with this command:
```python
python my_scraper.py
```
